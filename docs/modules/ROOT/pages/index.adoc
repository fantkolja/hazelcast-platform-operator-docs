When submitting a ticket to the team, provide the following information:

* *A clear summary of the issue*. Add this in the title of your issue to help the team to direct the issue to the right expert.
* *The steps to take to reproduce the issue*, if possible. If you aren't sure, describe the sequence of events that led to the problem. Your test case, or use case is also very helpful.
* *A full description of the problem and any error* that was encountered. Your test and use cases can provide us with guidance on where we need to focus our investigations. Include the time at which you encountered the issue.
* *Hazelcast Logs*. Ensure that all your environments capture Hazelcast diagnostics logs, which we will use to diagnose your issues. If your environments are not capturing diagnostics logs, update them and capture diagnostics logs before opening the ticket. Do not truncate the diagnostic logs. The process, health monitoring, and networking logs also contain useful information, and should be attached along with the diagnostic logs when you open a ticket. Ensure that system and environment details captured at system startup are included, even in truncated logs, and that the provided logs include entries for the time at which you encountered the issue. 
* *Relevant screenshots and/or error messages*.
* *Thread dumps for all members*.
* *Heap dumps*.
* *The severity of the issue*, as follows:

** `PROD` issues affecting production: severity 1.

** `DEV` issues: severity 3 and priority low.

** Other issues, such as questions or documentation feedback: severity 2 or 3 depending on severity.

The more information that you can provide, the faster Hazelcast Customer Support can respond to your issue. Hazelcast appreciates your help and timely response to any further communication.
