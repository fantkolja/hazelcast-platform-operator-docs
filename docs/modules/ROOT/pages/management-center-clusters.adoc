= Connecting to a Hazelcast Cluster
:description: You can connect Management Center to multiple clusters.

To connect Management Center to a Hazelcast cluster, you need to configure at least the name of the cluster and the addresses of one or more members.

You can connect Management Center to a cluster that is configured to use TLS.

See xref:management-center:deploy-manage:cluster-connections.adoc[Management Center Documentation] for more detailed information.

WARNING: `hazelcastClusters` field does not support deleting clusters from the custom resource. If you want to remove a cluster from the Management Center, you can do it from the Management Center UI.

=== Example Management Center configuration

The example configuration below does the following:

- Configuring connection to a Hazelcast cluster using `hazelcast` DNS name
- Use `dev` Hazelcast cluster name

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/management-center-clusters.yaml[]
----

=== Example Management Center with TLS Configuration

The example configuration below does the following:

- Configuring connection to a Hazelcast cluster using `hazelcast` DNS name
- Use `dev` Hazelcast cluster name
- Connect to Hazelcast cluster with TLS certificate defined in `example` secret

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/management-center-tls.yaml[]
----

You can create TLS secret from existing PEM certificate:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl create secret generic example \
  --from-file=tls.crt=example.crt \
  --from-file=tls.key=example.key
----
