= Enabling Lite Members

To be able to enable lite members Hazelcast Platform Operator accepts a parameter `liteMemberCount` in Hazelcast CR configuration.

.Example Configuration

There are some limitations while setting `liteMemberCount`:

- `liteMemberCount` cannot be greater than or equal to `clusterSize`.
- `liteMemberCount` cannot be updated. When you scale a cluster, it will scale the data members.
