= Configure MultiMaps
:description: pass:q[Hazelcast MultiMap, also known as IMultiMap, is a specialized map where you can store multiple values under a single key. Just like any other distributed data structure implementation in Hazelcast, MultiMap is distributed and thread-safe. You can create and configure MultiMaps using the MultiMap custom resource.]

{description}

== Configure a MultiMap Resource

The MultiMap custom resource is configured using the following fields: 

[cols="20%m,80%a"]
|===
|Field|Description

|name
|The name of the MultiMap configuration being created. If this field is empty, the custom resource name is used to create the name of the MultiMap.

|hazelcastResourceName
|The name of the Hazelcast resource for which the MultiMap configuration is created.

|backupCount
|The count of synchronous backups.

|binary
|The format in which to store all MultiMap values. If set to `true` all values are stored in BINARY format, otherwise values are stored in OBJECT format.

|collectionType
|The type of the value collection. The type can be either `SET` or `LIST`. Use `SET` if ordering is unimportant, and you do not want to allow duplicate or null values. Use `LIST` if ordering is important and you want to allow duplicate, but not null, values.


|===

For further information on the fields used to configure MultiMaps, see xref:api-ref.adoc#multimapspec[MultiMapSpec] in the Hazelcast Operator API Reference.

== Example Configuration

In this example, we configure a MultiMap for the Hazelcast custom resource defined in the `hazelcastResourceName` field.

The configuration is as follows:

.Example configuration
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/multimap.yaml[]
----

Once created, you can use the following command to check the status of the MultiMap resource:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get multimap multimap-sample -o wide
----

The result is similar to the following:

```
NAME              STATUS    HAZELCAST-RESOURCE   MESSAGE
multimap-sample   Success   hazelcast
```
