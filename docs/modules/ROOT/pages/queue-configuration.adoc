= Configure Queues
:description: pass:q[Hazelcast distributed queue is an implementation of the thread-safe `java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue` construct. All cluster members can interact with Hazelcast distributed queue. For example, Hazelcast distributed queue allows you to add an item in one cluster member and remove it from another one. You can create and configure the queue using the Queue custom resource.]

{description}

== Configure a Queue Resource

The Queue resource is configured using the following fields: 

[cols="20%m,80%a"]
|===
|Field|Description

|name
|The name of the queue configuration being created. If this field is empty, the custom resource name is used to create the name of the queue.

|hazelcastResourceName
|The name of the Hazelcast resource for which the queue configuration is created.

|backupCount
|The count of synchronous backups.

|asyncBackupCount
|The count of asynchronous backups.

|maxSize
|The maximum size of the queue.

|emptyQueueTTLSeconds
|The time in seconds to wait before destroying the Queue if it remains empty or unused. If no value is provided, the Queue is never destroyed.

|priorityComparatorClassName
|The name of the comparator class. If the class name is provided, the Queue becomes Priority Queue.

|===

For further information on the fields used to configure queues, see xref:api-ref.adoc#queuespec[TopicSpec] in the Hazelcast Operator APi Reference.

== Example Configuration

In this example, we configure a queue for the Hazelcast custom resource defined in the `hazelcastResourceName` field.

The configuration is as follows:

.Example configuration
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/queue.yaml[]
----

Once created, you can use the following command to check the status of the Queue resource:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get queue queue-sample -o wide
----

The result is similar to the following:

```
NAME           STATUS    HAZELCAST-RESOURCE   MESSAGE
queue-sample   Success   hazelcast
```
