= Configure Cache
:description: pass:q[Hazelcast offers a specification-compliant JCache implementation. The Hazelcast JCache implementation is 100% Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) compliant and therefore passes all specification requirements. You can create and configure JCache using the Cache custom resource.]

== Configure a Cache Resource

The Cache resource is configured using the following fields: 

[cols="20%m,80%a"]
|===
|Field|Description

|name
|The name of the cache configuration being created. If this field is empty, the custom resource name is used to create the name of the queue.

|hazelcastResourceName
|The name of the Hazelcast resource for which the cache configuration is created.

|backupCount
|The count of synchronous backups.

|asyncBackupCount
|The count of asynchronous backups.

|keyType
|The fully qualified class name of the cache key type.

|valueType
|The fully qualified class name of the cache value type.

|persistenceEnabled
|Flag to enable persistence of the cache. When set, the cache data is persisted.

|inMemoryFormat
|The format to use when storing data in cache. This can be set to `BINARY`, `OBJECT`, or `NATIVE`.

|===

For further information on the fields used to configure cache, see xref:api-ref.adoc#cachespec[CacheSpec] in the Hazelcast Operator API Reference.

== Example Configuration

In this example, we configure a cache for the `Hazelcast` custom resource defined in the `hazelcastResourceName` field.

The configuration is as follows:

.Example configuration
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/cache.yaml[]
----

Once created, you can use the following command to check the status of the Cache resource:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get cache cache-sample -o wide
----

The result is similar to the following:

```
NAME           STATUS    HAZELCAST-RESOURCE   MESSAGE
cache-sample   Success   hazelcast
```
