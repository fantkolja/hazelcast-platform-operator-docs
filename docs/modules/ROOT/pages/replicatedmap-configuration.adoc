= Configure Replicated Maps
:description: pass:q[A replicated map is a distributed key-value data structure where the data is replicated to all members in the cluster. It provides full replication of entries to all members for high-speed access. You can create and configure replicated maps using the ReplicatedMap custom resource.]

{description}

== Configure a ReplicatedMap Resource

The ReplicatedMap resource is configured using the following fields: 

[cols="20%m,80%a"]
|===
|Field|Description

|name
|The name of the ReplicatedMap configuration being created. If this field is empty, the custom resource name is used to create the name of the ReplicatedMap:

|hazelcastResourceName
|The name of the Hazelcast resource.

|inMemoryFormat
|The format to use for internal storage. This can be set to either `OBJECT` or `BINARY`.

|asyncFillup
|Specifies whether to asynchronously fill the ReplicatedMap with entries. If set to `true` (default), calls to the ReplicatedMap during the initial replication can return `null` values. If set to `false`, calls to the ReplicatedMap are blocked until the initial replication has completed, and no exceptions are thrown.

|===

For further information on the fields used to configure ReplicatedData, see xref:api-ref.adoc#replicatedmapspec[ReplicatedMapSpec] in the Hazelcast Operator API Reference.

== Example Configuration

In this example, we configure a ReplicatedMap for the Hazelcast custom resource defined in the `hazelcastResourceName` field.

The configuration is as follows:

.Example configuration
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/replicatedmap.yaml[]
----

Once created, you can use the following command to check the status of the ReplicatedMap resource:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get replicatedmap replicatedmap-sample -o wide
----

The result is similar to the following:

```
NAME                   STATUS    HAZELCAST-RESOURCE   MESSAGE
replicatedmap-sample   Success   hazelcast
```
