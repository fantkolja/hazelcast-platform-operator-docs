= Configure Topics
:description: pass:q[Hazelcast provides a distribution mechanism for publishing messages that are delivered to multiple subscribers. This is known as a publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging model. Publishing and subscription operations are cluster wide. When a member subscribes to a topic, it is registered to receive messages published to that topic by any member in the cluster, including members that joined after it subscribed. You can create and configure topics using the Topic custom resource.]

== Configuring a Topic Resource

The Topic resource is configured using the following fields: 

[cols="20%m,80%a"]
|===
|Field|Description

|name
|The name of the topic configuration to create. If this field is empty, the custom resource name is used to create the name of the topic.

|hazelcastResourceName
|The name of the Hazelcast resource for which the topic configuration is created.

|globalOrderingEnabled
|Specifies whether to maintain the order of the messages. If set to `true`, all nodes listening to the same topic get their messages in the same order, otherwise the order of the messages can differ. This field cannot be set to `true` if the `multiThreadingEnabled` field is also set to `true`.

|multiThreadingEnabled
|Specifies whether to use multi- or single threaded processing. If set to `true`, multi-threaded processing of incoming messages is used, otherwise a single thread handles all topic messages. This field cannot be set to `true` if the `globalOrderingEnabled` field is also set to `true`.

|===

For further information on the fields used to configure Topics, see xref:api-ref.adoc#topicspec[TopicSpec] in the Hazelcast Operator APi Reference.

== Example Configuration

In this example, we configure a Topic for the Hazelcast custom resource defined in the `hazelcastResourceName` field.

The configuration is as follows:

.Example configuration
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/topic.yaml[]
----

Once created, you can use the following command to check the status of the Topic resource:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get topic topic-sample -o wide
----

The result is similar to the following:

```
NAME           STATUS    HAZELCAST-RESOURCE   MESSAGE
topic-sample   Success   hazelcast-sample
```
