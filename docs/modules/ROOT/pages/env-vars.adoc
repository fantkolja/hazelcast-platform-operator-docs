= Configuring Environment Variables

You can configure the environment variables in the `hazelcast` pods using the `env` field of the CRD spec. `env` field supports the same format with link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.27/#envvar-v1-core/[Kubernetes' EnvVar format].

WARNING: You cannot use the `env` field to configure Hazelcast environment variables, which are prefixed `HZ_`. To configure the Hazelcast environment variables, use xref:custom-config.adoc[Custom Config].
