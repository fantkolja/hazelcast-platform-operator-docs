= Configuring Environment Variables

You can configure the environment variables in the `hazelcast` pods using the `env` field of the CRD spec.

Example Configuration:
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/env-vars.yaml[]
----

WARNING: You cannot use the `env` field to configure Hazelcast environment variables, which are prefixed `HZ_`. To configure the Hazelcast environment variables, use xref:custom-config.adoc[Custom Config].
