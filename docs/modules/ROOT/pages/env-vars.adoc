= Configuring Environment Variables

You can configure the environment variables in the `hazelcast` pods using the `env` field of the CRD spec.

Example Configuration:
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/env-vars.yaml[]

WARNING: Environment variables to configure Hazelcast (environment variables with `HZ_` prefix) cannot be configured using `env` field. You should use xref:custom-config.adoc[Custom Config] to configure Hazelcast.
