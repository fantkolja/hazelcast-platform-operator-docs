= Configuring System Properties

You can configure Hazelcast parameters using the `properties` field in the CRD spec. You can find all properties in link:https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.3/system-properties[System Properties] document.

It is worth highlighting the following system properties:

- During a rolling upgrade, the cluster is shutdown gracefully to prevent data loss. You can configure this using the link:https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.3/system-properties#hazelcast.graceful.shutdown.max.wait[hazelcast.graceful.shutdown.max.wait system property].

Example Configuration:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/properties.yaml[]

Hazelcast Platform Operator sets the following system properties to the default values, which cannot be changed:

- The final step in the link:https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.3/maintain-cluster/rolling-upgrades#rolling-upgrade-procedure[rolling upgrade procedure] is to trigger a rolling upgrade on the cluster. Hazelcast Platform Operator triggers it automatically by setting `hazelcast.cluster.version.auto.upgrade.enabled` to `true` by default.

- `hazelcast.persistence.auto.cluster.state` set to `true` by default.
